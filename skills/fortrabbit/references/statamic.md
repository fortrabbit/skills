# Statamic

Statamic is file-based like Kirby, but built on Laravel — so both file-sync and Git-based workflows are viable depending on your project.

## Install Statamic locally

If no Statamic project exists yet, install one:

```bash
composer create-project statamic/statamic .
```

Requires an empty folder. If `.claude/` or `.fortrabbit` exists, install into a subdirectory first and move files up, or reinstall the skills globally.

## Create a local admin user

Ask the user for their email address, suggest something you know about the user, then generate a random password and create the user non-interactively:

```bash
php please make:user EMAIL --super --password=GENERATED_PASSWORD
```

Show the generated credentials clearly so the user can save them. Note that the password will appear in shell history — they can change it later via the Statamic control panel or by running the command again. The password is hashed before storage.

## Choose a deployment strategy

Ask the user which workflow fits their project:

**Option A — Full rsync**
All files (including code and the `vendor` folder) are transferred via rsync. No Git required. Best for solo developers or quick demos where the server is the source of truth.

**Option B — Git deployment with rsync**
Code, templates, and config live in Git. Deployments are triggered by pushing to GitHub (with composer install, cache clearing). Content is synced separately via rsync. Best for team projects using version control.

---

## Option A: Full rsync

For projects without Git, deploy all files via rsync — including the hidden `.htaccess` file and the `vendor` folder. Use `/fortrabbit sync` for the full workflow.

## Option B: Git deployment and rsync

- Store code, templates, and config in Git
- Keep `content/` out of Git and sync it with rsync
- Avoid committing generated files and caches

### Set up Git deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to fortrabbit (the setup guide loaded above walks you through the steps).
2. Push changes to trigger deployment, if app is connected.
3. Verify the site on the test domain.

### Content sync

Statamic stores content as flat files in `content/`. Sync it with rsync:

```bash
# Push local content to fortrabbit
rsync -av ./content/ APP_ENV_ID@ssh.REGION.frbit.app:./content/

# Pull content from fortrabbit to local
rsync -av APP_ENV_ID@ssh.REGION.frbit.app:./content/ ./content/
```

For detailed content sync commands, use `/fortrabbit content sync`.

## Notes

- Statamic is built on Laravel — if your project uses a database, use `/fortrabbit db` for pull/push operations.
- Keep `.env` out of Git; commit only non-secret config.
- After deployment, check your site at `https://APP_ENV_ID.REGION.frbit.app`. Use `/fortrabbit review` for a full response check with error diagnosis.
