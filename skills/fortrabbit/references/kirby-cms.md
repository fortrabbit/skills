# Kirby CMS

Kirby is a file-based CMS with no database. It works well with Git deployment on fortrabbit.

## Check local setup

If no Kirby project exists yet, install one:

```bash
composer create-project getkirby/starterkit .
```

Requires an empty folder. If `.claude/` or `.fortrabbit` exists, install into a subdirectory first and move files up, or reinstall the skills globally.

## Choose a deployment strategy

Ask:

> "How do you want to deploy?
>   A) Rsync (recommended for solo) — sync all files directly without Git
>   B) Git + rsync (recommended for teams) — code in GitHub, content synced separately with rsync"

```
IF answer == A (rsync)
  → Load sync.md

IF answer == B (Git)
  → Load setup-git-github.md

IF unsure
  → Ask: "Are you working solo or with a team?"
    IF solo → recommend A (rsync), load sync.md
    IF team → recommend B (Git + rsync), load setup-git-github.md
```

**Option A — Full rsync**
All files (including code) are transferred via rsync. No Git required. Best for solo developers or projects where the server is the source of truth.

**Option B — Git deployment with rsync**
Code, templates, and config live in Git. Deployments are triggered by pushing to GitHub. Content is synced separately with rsync. Best when the team uses version control.

---

## Option A: Full rsync

For projects without Git, deploy all files via rsync. Use `/fortrabbit sync` for the full workflow.

## Option B: Git deployment and rsync

- Store code and templates in Git
- Keep `content/` and `site/accounts/` out of Git and sync via rsync
- Avoid committing generated files and caches

### Set up Git deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to fortrabbit (the setup guide loaded above walks you through the steps).
2. Push changes to trigger deployment, if app is connected.
3. Verify the site on the test domain.

### Content and asset sync

Kirby stores content in `content/` and media in `site/assets/` or `content/` depending on configuration. Sync them with rsync:

```bash
rsync -av ./content/ APP_ENV_ID@ssh.REGION.frbit.app:./content/
rsync -av ./site/assets/ APP_ENV_ID@ssh.REGION.frbit.app:./site/assets/
```

If your project stores media elsewhere, update the source and destination paths accordingly.

For detailed content sync commands, use `/fortrabbit content sync`.

## Notes

- Kirby is file-based — content sync and Git strategy should match your project structure.
- Keep `.env` out of Git; commit only non-secret config.
- After deployment, check your site at `https://APP_ENV_ID.REGION.frbit.app`. Use `/fortrabbit review` for a full response check with error diagnosis.
