description: >
  Use this skill when managing, deploying, or troubleshooting a web app or
  website hosted on fortrabbit. Covers git push deployments, deploy hook
  triggers, remote SSH commands (artisan, craft console, wp-cli), database
  pull/push via SSH tunnel, file and content sync via rsync, and environment
  onboarding. Supports Laravel, Craft CMS, Kirby, Statamic, WordPress, and
  generic PHP. Also use when the user mentions SSH key setup, a fortrabbit
  dashboard action, or a frbit.app hostname — even if they don't say
  "fortrabbit" explicitly.
compatibility: >
  Requires git, SSH (port 22), and network access to fortrabbit.com and
  ssh.REGION.frbit.app. Database operations require a local MySQL client.
  rsync required for file sync operations. Designed for Claude Code.

## Step 0 — Periodic update check

Run this silently before any user-facing action on first invocation within a session. Do not mention it to the user unless an update is found. Skip if already run this session.

Find the skill install directory:

```sh
if [ -f ".claude/skills/fortrabbit/.version" ]; then
  SKILL_DIR=".claude/skills/fortrabbit"
else
  SKILL_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/fortrabbit"
fi
```

Check when the last update check ran:

```sh
LAST=$(cat "$SKILL_DIR/.last-update-check" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
NOW=$(date +%s)
echo $((NOW - LAST))
```

If the result is greater than `604800` (7 days):

1. Write the current timestamp immediately so the next invocation skips the check:
   ```sh
   date +%s > "$SKILL_DIR/.last-update-check"
   ```
2. Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortrabbit/agent-skills/main/VERSION` with a 5-second timeout. If the fetch times out or fails (network error, non-200), skip silently — do **not** update the timestamp so the check retries next session.
3. Read `$SKILL_DIR/.version` for the local version.
4. If remote version is non-empty and differs from local, tell the user: "fortrabbit agent-skills v{REMOTE} is available (you have v{LOCAL}). Run `/fortrabbit update` to install."
5. If they match, continue silently.

## Step 1 — Find the project configuration

Read config in this order (`.fortrabbit` is source of truth):

1. **Read `.fortrabbit` first.** If it exists, use `app-env-id` and `region` from it.
2. **Supplement from `.env`** — if either value is missing from `.fortrabbit`, read `FORTRABBIT_APP_ENV_ID` and/or `FORTRABBIT_REGION` from `.env`.
3. **If still missing**, ask the user: "What is your fortrabbit app environment ID?" (format: `en-wjl0ai`) and "What region is your app in?" (default: `eu-w1a`).
4. **If both files define the same key with different values**, do not merge silently — ask: "I found two different app IDs: `[value-a]` (`.fortrabbit`) and `[value-b]` (`.env`). Which is correct?"

For deploy hook operations, also read `FORTRABBIT_DEPLOY_HOOK_SECRET` from `.env`. Construct the URL as:
`https://api.fortrabbit.com/webhooks/environments/{app-env-id}/deploy/{secret}`

The SSH host is always: `APP_ENV_ID@ssh.REGION.frbit.app`

## Fetching fortrabbit docs

When fetching any `https://docs.fortrabbit.com/` URL, rewrite it to the raw markdown source before fetching:

`https://docs.fortrabbit.com/guides/foo/bar` → `https://docs.fortrabbit.com/raw/guides/foo/bar.md`

This gives clean markdown instead of HTML.

## Step 2 — Route by intent

Match the user's input against these conditions in order (first match wins):

```
IF input contains any of: "deploy", "push", "trigger", "hook", "git push"
  → Load references/deploy.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "ssh key", "public key", "permission denied", "key setup", "add key"
  → Load references/ssh-key-setup.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "ssh", "remote command", "artisan", "craft console", "wp-cli", "console"
  → Load references/ssh-exec.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "database", "db pull", "db push", "db down", "db up", "mysql", "dump", "restore"
  → Load references/database.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "content sync", "sync content", "sync uploads", "sync assets", "sync down", "sync up"
  → Load references/sync-content.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "rsync", "sync files", "sync all", "upload files", "download files"
  → Load references/sync.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "github", "git setup", "connect git", "setup deployment", "setup git"
  → Load references/setup-git-github.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "review", "check site", "is it live", "test domain", "browser"
  → Load references/browser-review.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "404", "500", "502", "503", "504", "not loading", "curl fails", "http error"
  → Load references/http-error-troubleshooting.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "local", "local dev", "ddev", "valet", "herd", "lando", "docker"
  → Load references/local-development.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "detect", "what cms", "which software", "project type"
  → Load references/software-detection.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "craft", "craftcms"
  → Load references/craft-cms.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "kirby"
  → Load references/kirby-cms.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "wordpress", "wp"
  → Load references/wordpress.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "connect", "onboard", "first time", "get started"
  → Load references/connect.md

ELSE IF input is empty or contains any of: "start", "help", "setup", "begin", "what can you do"
  → Load references/start.md

ELSE IF input contains any of: "update"
  → Run the update command below

ELSE IF input contains any of: "uninstall", "remove"
  → Run the uninstall command below

ELSE
  → Ask: "What would you like to do? Options: deploy, run a remote command, sync the database, sync files, set up Git, check your site, or get started with onboarding."

## Uninstall command

When the user invokes `/fortrabbit uninstall`:

1. Look for `uninstall.sh` in `.claude/skills/fortrabbit/uninstall.sh` (project) or `~/.claude/skills/fortrabbit/uninstall.sh` (global).
2. If found, run it with `sh uninstall.sh` from its directory. It will list what will be removed and ask for confirmation before deleting anything.
3. If not found, tell the user to manually delete the skill directories:
   - Project: `.claude/skills/fortrabbit/`, `.agents/skills/fortrabbit/`, `.github/instructions/fortrabbit.instructions.md`
   - Global: `~/.claude/skills/fortrabbit/`, `~/.agents/skills/fortrabbit/`

---

## Update command

When the user invokes `/fortrabbit update`:

1. Look for `update.sh` in `.claude/skills/fortrabbit/update.sh` (project) or `~/.claude/skills/fortrabbit/update.sh` (global).
2. If found, run it with `bash update.sh` from its directory. It will compare versions and reinstall if a newer version is available.
3. If not found (old install without update.sh), show this command and ask the user to run it manually:
   ```
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortrabbit/agent-skills/main/install.sh | sh
   ```
   (append ` -s -- --local` to install per-project instead of globally)

---

## Safety rules

- Always show the full command before running it.
- For `db push` (overwriting remote data): ask "This will overwrite the remote database. Are you sure?" and wait for explicit confirmation.
- For `db pull` (overwriting local data): warn "This will overwrite your local database."
- For SSH exec commands that modify state (artisan migrate, cache clear, queue flush): show the command and confirm.
- Never run `DROP DATABASE`, `DROP TABLE`, or `TRUNCATE` without displaying the statement and requiring explicit user confirmation.
- Never store database passwords in files. Use the SSH tunnel method only.
- If the SSH connection fails, classify the error before acting:
  - `Permission denied (publickey)` → Load [references/ssh-key-setup.md](references/ssh-key-setup.md)
  - `Connection timed out`, `Connection refused`, `Network is unreachable` → Tell the user: "Could not reach fortrabbit. Check: (1) internet connection, (2) port 22 not blocked by firewall or VPN, (3) correct region." Ask which might be the issue.
  - Any other error → Show the full error text and say: "Something unexpected happened. Here's the error: [ERROR]." then load [references/connect.md](references/connect.md).

---

## Gotchas

- **Config conflict**: if `.fortrabbit` and `.env` define the same key with different values, always ask — never silently prefer one over the other.
- **Region default**: when the user hasn't specified a region, default to `eu-w1a` but confirm with them before first use.
- **Deploy hook secret**: the deploy hook URL requires `FORTRABBIT_DEPLOY_HOOK_SECRET` from `.env` — it is never in `.fortrabbit` (no secrets in committed files).
- **No direct DB connections**: database access is exclusively via SSH tunnel. Never attempt a direct remote MySQL connection.
- **SSH port**: fortrabbit uses port 22 exclusively. If `ssh` fails with a timeout, a firewall or VPN blocking port 22 is the most likely cause — not a credentials issue.
- **Framework detection**: presence of an `artisan` file takes precedence over `composer.json` contents for Laravel detection. `wp-config.php` alone is sufficient for WordPress — no composer check needed.
- **rsync trailing slashes matter**: omitting or adding a trailing `/` to source paths changes rsync behavior significantly. Always verify the paths in the reference file before running.
